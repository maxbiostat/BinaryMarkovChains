\title{Estimate of the "stable" effective sample for two-state Markov chains.}
\usage{
MC_neff_stable(samples, p = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{a vector of size N containing realisations of a two-state Markov chain.}

\item{p}{(optional) marginal success probability. If \code{p = NULL}, the sample mean will be used.}
}
\value{
estimated "stable" effective sample size
}
\description{
Estimate of the "stable" effective sample for two-state Markov chains.
}
\details{
This functions provides an estimate of the effective sample size by plugging in an estimate of alpha in the form of its
maximum \emph{a posteriori}  estimate (see \code{\link[BinaryMarkovChains]{get_alpha_map}}).
If p is not known (\code{p = NULL}) then the sample mean, \code{mean(samples)} is used as an estimate.
This is a version of \code{MC_neff()} that uses a slightly different denominator and \strong{will} give
different results than \code{MC_neff()}.

\examples{
X <- sample(c(0, 1), 1000, replace = TRUE)
MC_neff(samples = X, p = 1/2)
MC_neff(samples = X)
