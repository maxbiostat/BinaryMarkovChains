Sample a boolean variable of dimension 20 and not thinning for 100000 samples with as posterior an exponential distribution with mean=10 (or uniform[0,10000]) on the sum of values being true.

The MCMC proposal randomly selects a boolean value and flips the bit. 

So, every proposal leads to an independent sample for one of the bits, thus the expected ESS for a single dimension is 90000/20=4500 (using 10% burnin).
